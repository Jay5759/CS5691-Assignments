You need to modify the formula (possibly by introducing new variables) such that every variable occurs at most 5 times in the formula.
Will not be able to provide any further hint.

Good afternoon sir,

I am facing issue in Q2 of assignment 3 in which we need to show read - k 3SAT is NP-complete for k>=5.

I am unable to figure out how to reduce it.

I have also joined meet link of the class if possible can you please join the meet clarify my doubts on meet? 
Since NP-complete topic is covered is last so I am not able to grasp much things.

Thanks and regards
