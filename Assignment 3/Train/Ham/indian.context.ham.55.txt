Hi All,

In today's lecture there were some concerns about the Quiz2 date overlapping with an exam in ADSA. 

You can fill in your choices for the exam date in this form along with a final survey of the course: https://forms.gle/yGbJi8SrTCQU9Npc8

In particular, I would like to know the reasons behind the low attendance over the past couple of weeks and what could have been done to improve that. Please fill the form asap. 

Thanks,

~Mitesh
