Dear All,
Moodle server seems to be down for the past 2 hours. I am in touch with the institute staff who are trying to restore it.  It can take several hours before the server is restored. 
Will keep you posted and we will take a decision on modalities for making up for the lost time once the server is restored.

Sorry for the convenience.
Best

PS: I am desperately hoping that there will be no data loss,
