Tutorial 10 has been uploaded on moodle. 

The last 4 questions in the tutorial are related to the Bayes' rule that we were discussing today (2 discrete, 2 continuous, 1 discrete 1 continuous, 1 continuous 1 discrete).

It would be great if one/some of you could post the code (colab notebook) for the plots asked in these Qs so that others can also benefit and play around with the code.
