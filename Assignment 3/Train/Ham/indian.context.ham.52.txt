Hi, 

I have been informed (rather late) that some students have an exam on 23rd Dec. 

I had specifically asked multiple times in the class about disclosing all exam dates but no one mentioned 23rd Dec. Even when I announced this date in class no one spoke up. This is rather annoying and unnecessary wastes my time. 

I am left with no choice but to shift the exam date to 24th Dec, 3:00 pm. I hope there are no concerns with this date. 

Thanks,
